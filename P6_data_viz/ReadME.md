# Data Visualization Project - Titanic Dataset

## Summary
The project is based on information of titanic passengers. It visualize/analyze how different groups of people (age, sex, class) have different survival percentage.

## Design
In the previous data analysis project, I was working on the same dataset. So this project is really an html visualization version of that adding some cool stuff to the results. I want to show the histgrams which works great for comparing different groups. In order to plot the graph I made a few more columns in the csv file grouping age/survival status.

## Feedbacks:
The first version of my html is really just a plain layout of every histgram. The most feedback (well actually everyone of my 5 users) I got is to create some interactive buttons so that the readers can choose what to look at. It also keeps the page cleaner. So I used buttons to seperate each view of the graphs.

Also at first I only have the sky blue part showing the survival percentage. But some feel that although you can do a simple math (1-survival%) it is still much better to give both data. So now I have the light gray for those not survived so that both number discriptions can be put on the graph. 

One of the users was interested in where I got the data from. So I also included the link to kaggle on the page.
