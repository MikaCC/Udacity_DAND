# Data Visualization Project - Titanic Dataset

## Summary
The project is based on information of titanic passengers. It visualize/analyze how different groups of people (age, sex, class) have different survival percentage.

## Design
In the previous data analysis project, I was working on the same dataset. So this project is really an html visualization version of that adding some cool stuff to the results. I want to create bar charts which works great for comparing different groups. In order to plot the graph I made a few more columns in the csv file grouping age/survival status.

## Feedbacks:
index.html is the initial version.
index3. html is the final version.

Feedback 1:
"I don't like the orange" - a coworker of mine commented on the initial html. She thinks that the analysis is focus on what affect survival rate and the color of those 'not survived' is way too poped up. She also suggested that I should add some brief comments under each graph so people understand what conclusion I am trying to draw.
I took both the suggestions, changed the color tone in a later version and added a brief comment under each graph.

Feedback 2:
"Why the page starts with blank?â€œ "Make some difference so that I know I clicked on the button already."
I am not sure about the first one but I put the first graph when the page is loaded for now. (I will just comment the code out again if I changed my mind). And I added a after clicked feature for the buttons as well.

Feedback 3:
"Where did you get the data? Where I should go to if I am interested in th topic?"
I think this is a great question and I added the linke to the Kaggle forum with the data description.
